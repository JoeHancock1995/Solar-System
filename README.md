# Solar-System

This web application is a work in progress with the goal of making a model of our solar system including the planets, moons, asteroids, satellites, and more. 

The goal of this app is to make the solar system interactive and have educational value.

This application built with BabylonJS.

## Seperate versions

Currently the Babylon.js version is working. Unfortunately the issue of individual planet orbits has put this version on hiatus while a three.js version is created. To run this just open the index.html file within the SolarSystem(Babylon.js) folder on a server.
